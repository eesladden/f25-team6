## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
Describe the purpose of the SRS and its intended audience.

### 1.2 Product Scope
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Explain what the product that is covered by this SRS will do, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem. 
Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 1.4 References
List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

### 1.5 Document Overview
Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.

## 2. Product Overview
This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.

### 2.1 Product Functions
* Profile Management (customer/provider)
* Listing & Search (browse, filter, sort)
* Offer/Counter-Offer System (barter only)
* Estimated Value Guidance (mock index or TCGplayer's offical API)
* Watchlists & Notifications
* Review & Reputation System
* In-App Messaging

### 2.2 Product Constraints
* Implemented as a web application (browser-based).
* Backend hosted on a cloud service (e.g., Firebase, AWS, or UNCG server).
* No real money transactions; all trades are barter-only.
* Dependence on TCGplayer API for price guidance (subject to rate limits & ToS).
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
  * Customer users
* Role & purpose: Customers are collectors who primarily use the platform to browse, discover, and trade cards.
* Functions used: Search listings, view card details, make and respond to trade offers, maintain watchlists, message providers, and leave reviews.
* Frequency of use: May log in a few times per week depending on trade activity or new listings.
* Technical expertise: Moderate; most will have general web browsing and account management skills.
* Privileges: Limited to their own profiles, offers, and reviews. Cannot edit other usersâ€™ listings or reviews.

  * Provider users
* Role & purpose: Providers are users who actively list and manage cards for trade and interact with multiple customers.
* Functions used: Create, update, and remove listings. Respond to trade offers and view customer statistics. Reply to reviews and manage their profile's reputation.
* Frequency of use: Typically more frequent than customers. Daily or multiple times per week to manage inventory and respond to offers.
* Technical expertise: Slightly higher than customers. May be familiar with inventory systems or online marketplace platforms.
* Privileges: Can create and manage multiple listings.


### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
* Assume continuous internet access.
* Dependence on TCGplayer API for optional live pricing.
* Mock index ensures functionality even if live API is unavailable.
* Users are responsible for physical shipping; Trade Table does not provide a check out or payment method. Users must decide via website DM how they want to exhange their products.
