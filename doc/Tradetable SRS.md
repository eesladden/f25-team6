### 1.5 Document Overview
Section 1 is just a general overview of the system, its purpose, and what it is. Section 2 includes more about the specific application being created, including functions and constraints. Section 3 goes into more detail about the specific funtions of the system, broken down into customer fuctions and provider functions.

## 2. Product Overview
The Tradetable application is a web-based platform designed to allow the user to communicate and trade cards. Users can create customizable profiles and listings for cards for trade, then negotiate price and meeting place. They will also be able to view traders in there local area.

### 2.1 Product Functions
* Profile Management (customer/provider)
* Listing & Search (browse, filter, sort)
* Offer/Counter-Offer System (barter only)
* Estimated Value Guidance (mock index or TCGplayer's offical API)
* Watchlists & Notifications
* Review & Reputation System
* In-App Messaging

### 2.2 Product Constraints
* Implemented as a web application (browser-based).
* Backend hosted on a cloud service (e.g., Firebase, AWS, or UNCG server).
* No real money transactions; all trades are barter-only.
* Dependence on TCGplayer API for price guidance (subject to rate limits & ToS).
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
  * Customer users
* Role & purpose: Customers are collectors who primarily use the platform to browse, discover, and trade cards.
* Functions used: Search listings, view card details, make and respond to trade offers, maintain watchlists, message providers, and leave reviews.
* Frequency of use: May log in a few times per week depending on trade activity or new listings.
* Technical expertise: Moderate; most will have general web browsing and account management skills.
* Privileges: Limited to their own profiles, offers, and reviews. Cannot edit other usersâ€™ listings or reviews.

  * Provider users
* Role & purpose: Providers are users who actively list and manage cards for trade and interact with multiple customers.
* Functions used: Create, update, and remove listings. Respond to trade offers and view customer statistics. Reply to reviews and manage their profile's reputation.
* Frequency of use: Typically more frequent than customers. Daily or multiple times per week to manage inventory and respond to offers.
* Technical expertise: Slightly higher than customers. May be familiar with inventory systems or online marketplace platforms.
* Privileges: Can create and manage multiple listings.

* Assume continuous internet access.
* Dependence on TCGplayer API for optional live pricing.
* Mock index ensures functionality even if live API is unavailable.
